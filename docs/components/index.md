Components are reusable parts of a user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications. Individual components can be used in multiple different pages, patterns and context.

Components at this level are intended to be used across HMPPS Court cases and release dates within DPS. 

See [Get started](/get-started) to use these components in your service.
