Components are reusable parts of a user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications. Individual components can be used in multiple different pages, patterns and context.

Components at this level are intended to be used across HMPPS and DPS. Components that are targeted at a specific set of services or subdomains should be added to the components of a product set.

See [Get started](/get-started) to use these components in your service.
